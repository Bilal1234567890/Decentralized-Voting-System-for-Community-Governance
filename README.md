# Project documentation 
Here's a **complete project structure** for a **Stacks Foundation**-oriented project using **Clarity language**, including code implementation for a **decentralized voting system**. This project aligns with Stacks' mission to enable trustless governance and decentralized applications.

---

### **Project Overview**
**Title**: *Decentralized Voting System for Community Governance*  
**Purpose**: Allow Stacks community members to vote on proposals using a trustless, on-chain smart contract.  
**Key Features**:  
- Add candidates/proposals  
- Vote for candidates  
- Retrieve vote counts  
- Access control for proposal management

### **Clarity Code Implementation**
#### **1. Voting System Contract (`voting-system.clar`)**
```clarity
;; Define constants
(define-constant MAX-CANDIDATES 10)
(define-constant MAX-CANDIDATE-NAME-LENGTH 32)

;; Data structures
(define-map candidates (string-ascii) uint)
(define-map voters (principal) bool)  ;; Track voters to prevent double voting
(define-constant owner tx-sender)     ;; Contract owner

;; Add a candidate (only owner)
(define-public (add-candidate (name string-ascii))
  (begin
    (asserts! (contract-own? tx-sender) (err 1))  ;; Only owner can add candidates
    (asserts! (< (map-size candidates) MAX-CANDIDATES) (err 2))  ;; Max candidates limit
    (asserts! (<= (string-length? name) MAX-CANDIDATE-NAME-LENGTH) (err 3))  ;; Name length limit
    (map-set candidates name 0)
    (ok true)))

;; Vote for a candidate
(define-public (vote (candidate-name string-ascii))
  (begin
    (asserts! (map-has-key? candidates candidate-name) (err 4))  ;; Candidate must exist
    (asserts! (not (map-get? voters tx-sender)) (err 5))  ;; Prevent double voting
    (map-set voters tx-sender true)  ;; Mark voter as having voted
    (let ((current-votes (map-get? candidates candidate-name)))
      (map-set candidates candidate-name (+ current-votes 1))
      (ok true))))

;; Get vote count for a candidate
(define-read-only (get-vote-count (candidate-name string-ascii))
  (map-get? candidates candidate-name))

;; Get all candidates
(define-read-only (get-all-candidates)
  (map-values candidates))
```

---

### **2. Test Contract (`test-voting.clar`)**
```clarity
;; Test voting system
(import (test-helpers) "test-helpers")

(define-test (test-add-candidate)
  (with-deployer
    (contract-call? .voting-system add-candidate "Proposal A")
    (contract-call? .voting-system add-candidate "Proposal B"))
  (assert-eq (map-size (contract-call? .voting-system get-all-candidates)) 2))

(define-test (test-vote)
  (with-deployer
    (contract-call? .voting-system add-candidate "Proposal A"))
  (with-simulated-blockchain
    (contract-call? .voting-system vote "Proposal A")
    (assert-eq (contract-call? .voting-system get-vote-count "Proposal A") 1)))
```

---

### **3. Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
stacks deploy \
  --network=testnet \
  --private-key=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  contracts/voting-system.clar
```

---

### **Key Components Explained**
1. **Contracts**:  
   - `voting-system.clar`: Core logic for adding candidates, voting, and retrieving results.  
   - `test-voting.clar`: Unit tests for contract functionality.  

2. **Access Control**:  
   - Only the contract owner can add candidates.  
   - Voters can only vote once per candidate.  

3. **Security**:  
   - Uses Clarity's `asserts!` for input validation.  
   - Prevents double voting via a `voters` map.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - Limits to 10 candidates and 32-character names to prevent spam.

### **How to Use**
1. **Install Tools**:  
   - [Stacks CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/references/stacks-cli)  
   - [Clarity Compiler](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain)  

2. **Compile & Deploy**:  
   ```bash
   clarity compile contracts/voting-system.clar
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Test**:  
   ```bash
   clarity test tests/test-voting.clar
   ```

4. **Interact**:  
   Use the Stacks CLI or a frontend (e.g., [Stacks.js](https://docs.stacks.co/references/stacks-js)) to call contract functions.

### **Why This Project Fits Stacks**
- **Trustless Governance**: Enables community-driven decision-making.  
- **Formal Verification**: Clarity's type safety ensures secure code.  
- **Scalability**: Designed for small to medium-scale voting (e.g., DAO proposals).  

---

### **Potential Extensions**
- Add time-based voting (e.g., 7-day window).  
- Integrate with a frontend for user-friendly voting.  
- Add multi-signature support for proposal finalization.
